## Why This File Exists

The hackathon encourages builders to show how AI was used during development.  
This file is a **prompt-by-prompt log** of every major step — so judges (and anyone else) can **reproduce the entire project** by feeding these prompts into an AI coding assistant.

---

## Session 1 — Project Scaffolding

### Prompt 1: Initialize the project

```
npx create-next-app@latest wagmi-clinic --typescript --tailwind --eslint
cd wagmi-clinic
npx shadcn@latest init
npm install lucide-react framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

**What AI did:**

- Created a Next.js 16 app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint, App Router
- Initialized shadcn/ui with default config (Slate theme, CSS variables)
- Installed lucide-react, framer-motion, clsx, tailwind-merge

---

### Prompt 2: Custom theme utilities in globals.css

```
Update app/globals.css to add our "Clinical + Obsidian" theme utilities.

1. Keep the standard Tailwind directives.
2. Add custom utility classes:
   - .bg-noise: Adds a subtle grain texture (base64 SVG noise)
   - .bg-grid-pattern: Background grid pattern (slate-200 light, slate-800 dark)
   - .animate-glow-pulse: Slow breathing opacity animation for gold accents
3. Root Variables:
   - :root — --background: 0 0% 100%; --foreground: 0 0% 0%; --accent: #F0B90B;
   - .dark — --background: 0 0% 3%; --foreground: 0 0% 100%; --border: #F0B90B;
4. Body: min-h-screen font-sans antialiased bg-background text-foreground bg-noise
```

**What AI did:**

- Replaced shadcn's default oklch variables with the clinical theme
- Added `.bg-noise` using an inline SVG `feTurbulence` filter at 4% opacity
- Added `.bg-grid-pattern` with light/dark variants using hardcoded hex colors
- Added `.animate-glow-pulse` keyframes (3s ease-in-out, 0.6 → 1 opacity)
- Fixed Tailwind v4 compatibility: moved custom classes outside `@layer utilities` (Tailwind v4 can't `@apply` classes defined in `@layer utilities`)

**Lesson learned:** Tailwind v4 handles custom utility layers differently than v3. The AI caught and fixed the build error automatically.

---

## Session 2 — Landing Page (Hero)

### Prompt 3: Build the full landing page

```
Rewrite app/page.tsx to build the "Wagmi Clinic" Landing Page.

1. Layout: bg-noise, bg-grid-pattern, min-h-screen flex flex-col
2. Navbar (Fixed): Glassmorphism, "WAGMI CLINIC" logo with Activity icon in #F0B90B,
   nav links, theme toggle, "Emergency Scan" CTA
3. Hero: "IS YOUR WALLET HURTING?" headline (text-7xl, dark mode yellow glow),
   subheadline about AI diagnosis
4. Admit Patient Input: Large bordered input + "Admit Patient" button with ArrowRight
5. Stats Bar: "2,847 wallets treated • $12.4M recovered • 94% success rate" in monospace
6. Use framer-motion fadeUp animations, lucide-react icons, next-themes for dark mode
```

**What AI did:**

- Installed `next-themes`, created `ThemeProvider` wrapper component
- Updated `layout.tsx` with ThemeProvider (attribute="class", suppressHydrationWarning)
- Built the full page with framer-motion `fadeUp` variants (staggered custom delay)
- Added decorative glow blob for dark mode (`bg-[#F0B90B]/10 blur-[120px]`)
- Fixed TypeScript error: cast ease array as `[number, number, number, number]` tuple

---

### Prompt 4: Component-based refactor

```
Refactor app/page.tsx to use component-based approach
```

**What AI did:**

- Extracted shared animation config → `lib/animations.ts`
- Split into 4 focused components:
  - `components/navbar.tsx` — Glassmorphism nav + theme toggle (client component)
  - `components/hero-section.tsx` — Headline + subheadline with fadeUp
  - `components/admit-patient.tsx` — Wallet input with local useState
  - `components/stats-bar.tsx` — Data-driven stats from array
- `app/page.tsx` became a clean ~28-line server component composing everything

---

## Session 3 — Below-the-Fold Sections

### Prompt 5: Patient Dashboard, Care Programs, CTA, Footer

```
Create components for the Patient Dashboard, Care Programs, CTA Banner, and Footer
based on the Figma design screenshots.

Design Rules:
- 3-column grid (1 col mobile)
- Cards: border-2 border-black (light) / border-[#F0B90B]/30 with hover glow (dark)
- Icons: Black box + Yellow icon (light) / Yellow box + Black icon (dark)
- Checklists: lucide-react CheckSquare icons
```

**What AI did:**

- `components/patient-dashboard.tsx` — Wallet Health Score (32/100, critical), Loss Trajectory (-68% with SVG mini-chart), Prescription cards
- `components/care-programs.tsx` — 3 cards (Urgent Care, Physical Therapy, Group Therapy) with icon boxes, CheckSquare checklists, italic footers
- `components/cta-banner.tsx` — Yellow banner with "Ready to start your recovery?" and "Begin Treatment Now" button
- `components/footer.tsx` — Brand column, Services links, Community links, copyright with "NGMI → WAGMI"
- Updated `page.tsx` to import and compose all sections in order

---

## Session 4 — Background Pattern Evolution

### Prompt 6: Replace grid with surgical crosshair pattern

```
Replace the bg-grid-pattern in globals.css with a bg-surgical-pattern — a crosshair "+"
mark SVG pattern. Use #F0B90B stroke, 60px viewBox, 100px background-size, and add a
"breathe" animation that oscillates opacity from 0.1 to 0.25 over 8 seconds.
```

**What AI did:**

- Removed old `.bg-grid-pattern` class entirely
- Created `.bg-surgical-pattern` with an inline SVG crosshair (`M30 25V35M25 30H35`, stroke `#F0B90B`, stroke-width 2)
- Added `@keyframes breathe` (8s ease-in-out, 0.1 → 0.25 opacity)
- The crosshair grid gives the entire site a subtle medical instrument overlay feel

---

### Prompt 7: Add scanline animation + fix background layering

```
Add a scanning beam effect — a yellow-tinted horizontal gradient that sweeps vertically
down the page infinitely. Also restructure layout.tsx so the crosshair pattern is fixed
to the viewport and visible behind all content using a z-index layering system.
```

**What AI did:**

- Added `@keyframes scanline` (translateY from -100% to 100vh, 4s linear infinite)
- Created `.animate-scanline` class (fixed position, yellow gradient `rgba(240,185,11,0.1)`, pointer-events:none)
- Restructured `layout.tsx` with a 4-layer z-index system:
  - z-[-2] — Solid base layer (bg-white / dark:bg-[#050505])
  - z-[-1] — Surgical crosshair pattern (fixed, full viewport)
  - z-[0] — Scanline sweep beam
  - z-[10] — Main content
- Removed `bg-background` from `<body>` to prevent overlap

**Lesson learned:** Fixed backgrounds need explicit z-index layering in Next.js layouts, not just stacking on `<body>`.

---

### Prompt 8: Transparent containers

```
Make all section containers (patient-dashboard, care-programs, cta-banner, footer)
transparent so the crosshair pattern flows seamlessly behind everything. Cards keep
their backgrounds for readability.
```

**What AI did:**

- Stripped `bg-white`, `bg-slate-50`, `bg-black`, `bg-[#050505]` from all section wrappers
- Kept card-level backgrounds (white/black) for contrast and readability
- The crosshair pattern now flows uninterrupted from hero to footer

---

## Session 5 — Interactivity + Micro-animations

### Prompt 9: Beating heart emoji in hero

```
Add a beating heart animation — the 🫀 emoji in the hero headline should pulse with
framer-motion scale [1, 1.2, 1] infinitely at 0.8s intervals.
```

**What AI did:**

- Wrapped `🫀` in a `motion.span` with `animate={{ scale: [1, 1.2, 1] }}` and `transition={{ repeat: Infinity, duration: 0.8, ease: "easeInOut" }}`
- The heart now beats in the headline "Is Your W🫀llet Hurting?" — a subtle but memorable touch

---

### Prompt 10: Admit Patient input functionality

```
Make the "Admit Patient" input functional: useState for address, loading state
(isAdmitting), Enter key support, 800ms delay, then navigate to /diagnosis?address=...
Also add whileHover/whileTap framer-motion on the button.
```

**What AI did:**

- Added `useState(address)`, `useRouter()`, `isAdmitting` loading state
- `handleAdmit()`: validates input, sets loading, 800ms delay, then `router.push("/diagnosis?address=" + encodeURIComponent(address))`
- Enter key: `onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === "Enter" && handleAdmit()}`
- Button: `whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}`, `whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}`, swaps ArrowRight → Loader2 spinner when loading
- Disabled state styling during admission

---

## Session 6 — Diagnosis Page

### Prompt 11: Create the diagnosis route

```
Create app/diagnosis/page.tsx — a medical scanner UI:

Loading state (3 seconds):
- Pulsing Activity icon (scale + opacity animation)
- "SCANNING WALLET HISTORY..." title in monospace
- Animated progress bar (yellow, slides back and forth)
- Cycling scan messages every 800ms: "Checking Shitcoins...", "Analyzing Rug Pulls...",
  "Calculating Trauma...", etc.
- Show the wallet address being scanned

Loaded state:
- "Diagnosis Complete" card with ShieldAlert icon
- Truncated wallet address, CRITICAL status badge (red), 32/100 health score
- Placeholder for full treatment plan

Use Suspense boundary for useSearchParams, AnimatePresence for message transitions.
```

**What AI did:**

- Created `app/diagnosis/page.tsx` with `DiagnosisContent` (reads `?address=` from search params) wrapped in Suspense
- Loading state: `motion.div` pulsing icon, `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` for cycling messages, progress bar with `animate={{ x: ["-100%", "100%"] }}`
- Loaded state: bordered card with patient info table (address, CRITICAL badge, 32/100 score)
- 6 cycling scan messages for entertainment during the 3s fake scan
- Clean `font-mono` medical aesthetic throughout

---

## Session 7 — API Route + Diagnosis Dashboard

### Prompt 12: Create the diagnosis API route with chart data

```
Create app/api/diagnose/route.ts with mock wallet diagnosis logic.

1. Keep simulated delay (2.5s), score calculation.
2. Add generateHistory() — 30 data points representing last 30 days.
   - If address starts with "0x00" (Critical): downward trend (start high, end low).
   - Otherwise: volatile chop or upward trend.
3. Return JSON: { address, score, status, history: [{ day, value }] }
```

**What AI did:**

- Created `app/api/diagnose/route.ts` with GET handler
- `generateHistory(isCritical)`: generates 30 `{ day, value }` data points — critical wallets bleed from ~1000 with dead-cat bounces, healthy wallets chop around ~500 with upward bias
- Score logic: `0x00` addresses get 10–34 (CRITICAL), others get 50–89 (STABLE/UNSTABLE)
- Status derived from score thresholds: <35 CRITICAL, <60 UNSTABLE, else STABLE
- Full JSON response: `{ address, score, status, history }`

---

### Prompt 13: Create the WalletChart component

```
Create components/diagnosis/wallet-chart.tsx using recharts.

1. AreaChart with linearGradient fill, 300px height, transparent background.
2. Color: CRITICAL = red (#ef4444), else yellow (#F0B90B).
3. Hide axis lines, keep tick text (fill: #666, monospace).
4. Tooltip: black background, yellow border, white text.
5. Props: history: { day, value }[] and status: string.
```

**What AI did:**

- Created `components/diagnosis/wallet-chart.tsx` with Recharts `ResponsiveContainer` + `AreaChart`
- `linearGradient` id `colorValue` fading from 40% opacity to transparent
- Color-coded by status: red for CRITICAL, BNB yellow for everything else
- Clean monospace tick text, hidden axis lines, custom dark tooltip with `#F0B90B` border
- Installed `recharts` dependency

---

### Prompt 14: Add roasts and treatments to API

```
Update app/api/diagnose/route.ts to include roasts and treatments.

1. getRoast(status): Returns { title, message } — "Terminal Bagholder" (CRITICAL),
   "Paper Hands" (UNSTABLE), "Stablecoin Sedative" (STABLE).
2. getTreatments(status): Returns array of { title, url, type } links —
   DoraHacks/McDonalds/Wendy's for critical, Leverage Docs/Airdrops for stable.
3. Return expanded JSON with roast and treatments fields.
```

**What AI did:**

- Added `getRoast()` switch-case returning themed roast titles and messages per status
- Added `getTreatments()` returning 3 prescription links with type badges (Earn/Job/Cope for critical, Risk/Alpha/Wellness for stable)
- Updated GET response: `{ address, score, status, history, roast, treatments }`

---

### Prompt 15: Refactor diagnosis page to full bento grid dashboard

```
Refactor app/diagnosis/page.tsx to display the full diagnosis dashboard.

1. Bento Grid layout:
   - Top Left: Patient Info Card (wallet address, status badge, large health score)
   - Top Right: WalletChart component (30-day trajectory)
   - Bottom (full width): Diagnosis Card — roast title (yellow heading), roast message
     (monospace), treatments as clickable link buttons with type badges
2. Glassy Obsidian styling: bg-black/40 border border-[#F0B90B]/30 backdrop-blur-sm
3. Decorative Print button icon in header (just for vibe)
4. Fetch from /api/diagnose, with abort controller + error fallback
```

**What AI did:**

- Updated `DiagnosisData` type to include `roast: { title, message }` and `treatments: [{ title, url, type }]`
- Replaced single diagnosis card with 2-column CSS Grid bento layout
- Top Left: Patient file card with full address, dynamic status badge, `5xl` color-coded health score
- Top Right: `WalletChart` component consuming `history` data from API
- Bottom: Full-width diagnosis card — `roast.title` as large `#F0B90B` heading, `roast.message` in monospace, treatments rendered as styled `<a>` links with color-coded type badges (Earn=green, Job=amber, Cope=red, Risk=purple, Alpha=blue)
- Added Printer icon button in header for clinical aesthetic
- Error fallback includes empty roast/treatments so UI never breaks
- Staggered `motion.div` entrance animations on each card

---

## Session 8 — Grok Roasts + Prescription Pad

### Prompt 16: Populate GROK_ROASTS with 15 savage roasts

```
Populate the GROK_ROASTS constant with 15 hardcoded savage roasts.
Persona: Grok — savage, unhinged, loves roasting crypto degens.
Categories: CRITICAL (exit liquidity), UNSTABLE (paper hands), STABLE (boring).
Must be funny to AVERAGE people, not just crypto natives.
```

**What AI did:**

- Replaced the old 3-roast `getRoast()` switch with a `GROK_ROASTS` dictionary containing 15 roasts (5 per status)
- CRITICAL: "Financial Crime Scene", "Human ATM Machine", "The Reverse Midas", "Professional Bag Holder", "Scam Subscriber"
- UNSTABLE: "Panic Button Champion", "Trend Chaser Deluxe", "3 AM Decision Maker", "FOMO Patient Zero", "The Overthinker"
- STABLE: "The Human Savings Account", "Allergic to Fun", "The HODLer Fossil", "Spreadsheet Surgeon", "The Quiet Winner"
- Random selection per request so repeat visits get different roasts
- Rewrote all messages to be universally funny (no heavy crypto jargon)

---

### Prompt 17: Replace treatments with T.I.D Prescription system

```
Replace the old getTreatments() with a T.I.D (three times daily) prescription protocol.

1. YOUTUBE_VIDEOS array — 6 motivational video links
2. CRYPTO_QUOTES array — 6 crypto quotes (Satoshi, Vitalik, etc.)
3. getPrescription(status) returns { morning, noon, night } doses:
   - Morning (Hope): Random motivational video + truncated quote
   - Noon (Grind): DoraHacks for critical/unstable, BNB Airdrops for stable
   - Night (Cope): Touch Grass Protocol (lo-fi beats link)
4. Updated GET response: "prescription" replaces "treatments"
```

**What AI did:**

- Added `YOUTUBE_VIDEOS` (6 motivational links) and `CRYPTO_QUOTES` (6 quotes from Satoshi, Vitalik, Hal Finney, Saylor)
- Created `getPrescription(status)` returning 3 doses with `{ label, title, subtext, url, icon }` each
- Morning dose randomizes video + quote, Noon adapts by status, Night is always Touch Grass
- API response now returns `prescription: { morning, noon, night }` instead of `treatments: []`

---

### Prompt 18: Create PrescriptionPad component + wire into dashboard

```
Create components/diagnosis/prescription-pad.tsx — a medical Rx pad UI.

1. Medical header with "Rx" serif logo, "Wagmi Clinic" branding, "High Priority" badge
2. 3-column dose grid (morning/noon/night) with icon mapping (Sun/Moon/Briefcase)
3. Each dose is a clickable Link with hover underline + "OPEN LINK" footer
4. Footer with italic disclaimer + "Dr. Wagmi" signature (rotated handwriting style)
5. Wire into diagnosis page, replacing old treatments section
```

**What AI did:**

- Created `components/diagnosis/prescription-pad.tsx` with `PrescriptionPad` component
- Medical header: serif "Rx", clinic name, "Dr. Grok, M.D. (Degen Medicine)", red High Priority badge
- 3-column responsive grid with `divide-x` separators, hover states (`bg-yellow-50/50`)
- Icon mapping via `getIcon()` switch (Sun → orange, Moon → indigo, Briefcase → emerald)
- Footer: "\*Not financial advice. Side effects may include touching grass." + tilted signature
- Updated `DiagnosisData` type to use `prescription: { morning, noon, night }` instead of `treatments`
- Removed unused imports (`ExternalLink`, `Pill`) and `typeBadge` constant from diagnosis page
- Error fallback includes placeholder prescription doses
